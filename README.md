# lemon-spring-swagger-mongo
Another test repo to test out spring with swagger and mongo integration.
This is not polished by any means. Just a dumping ground to try out some new things.

## Prerequsities
You will need the following installed:
1. Gradle
2. Git
3. Some kind of IDE
4. Java SDK
5. MongoDB (if you want to use this part)

## How to use this master piece

1. Clone the repo into your IDE of choice (I went for Eclipse)
2. Build/run the app using the 'bootRun' task.
3. Go to [This Link](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html) to see Swagger
4. Try out the endpoints available
5. Have fun and play around with the code
